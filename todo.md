a few more things to update
1. we want to let user choose the input source, can default to the mac's mic
2. can we allow user to choose their own shortcut? and use a 'Shortcut' title with the selected shortcut shown at the end align with cmd+quickly
3. can we indicate two or three words of description for each model, cause user don't know how to choose. for example parakeet can be best for English, SenseVoice can be 中/En, not sure about whisper turbo. mine are just suggestions for you to start thinking, i believe you can propose better ways of hinting.
4. can we support onnx format of models for all three, how much workload would that be?
